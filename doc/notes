TODO
. measure against grounded input histogram (cf. ref[1])
. standard deviation = RMS noise
. 6.6 * RMS noise = peak to peak noise
. high DNL denotes bad ADC, electronics or PCB, cf. figure 3

this tool has 2 purposes:
. sequence an acquisition procedure: prepare
auxiliary devices, start stop acquisitions ...
. process data produced during the acquisition:
storage, analyses for ADC/DAC qualification,
plotting


signal generators:
keithley 2450
synthetic generators (sine ...)


acquisition sources: produce data
file (CSV, dump ...)
DAQ file


common input output representation
performant, array based


tools: analyze data


filters
low,high,band pass


typical processing chain:
acquisition -> file / buffer -> source -> analysis


type of analaysis
. noise free bits, histogram based
. linearity
. noise vs frequency
. long term drift
. frequency spectrum
. value versus time


data representation
. code
. voltage
. scaled
