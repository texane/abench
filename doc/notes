this tool has 2 purposes:
. sequence an acquisition procedure: prepare
auxiliary devices, start stop acquisitions ...
. process data produced during the acquisition:
storage, analyses for ADC/DAC qualification,
plotting


signal generators:
keithley 2450
synthetic generators (sine ...)


acquisition sources: produce data
file (CSV, dump ...)
DAQ file


common input output representation
performant, array based


tools: analyze data


filters
low,high,band pass


typical processing chain:
acquisition -> file / buffer -> source -> analysis


type of analaysis
